The field of computer science known as "natural language processing" (NLP) is more particularly the field of "artificial intelligence" (AI) that is concerned with providing computers the capacity to comprehend written and spoken words in a manner similar to that of humans.

NLP blends statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models with computational linguisticsâ€”rule-based modelling of human language. With the use of these technologies, computers are now able to interpret human language in the form of text or audio data and fully "understand" what is being said or written, including the speaker's or writer's intentions and mood.


In this study, I've looked at the following techniques: word segmentation, sentence segmentation, stop words removal, stemming, lemmatization, and part of speech tagger.
